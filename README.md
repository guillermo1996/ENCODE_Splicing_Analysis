# ENCODE Splicing Analysis
[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/611118810.svg)](https://zenodo.org/badge/latestdoi/611118810)

This repository contains the code necessary to execute the splicing noise analysis on the ENCODE shRNA knockdown samples. Using the metadata extracted from the [Encode Metadata Extraction](https://github.com/guillermo1996/ENCODE_Metadata_Extraction) repository and the script provided in [Splicing_Analysis_Script.R](https://github.com/guillermo1996/ENCODE_Splicing_Analysis/blob/main/Splicing_Analysis_Script.R), we measured the mis-splicing ratio for each annotated intron found across the different clusters.

This repository is based on the [splicing-accuracy-manuscript](https://github.com/SoniaRuiz/splicing-accuracy-manuscript) repository from Sonia Garc√≠a Ruiz, and was developed in order to provide additional information regarding the effects of an RNA binding protein knockdown on the splicing accuracy.
